### folder for generic iOS apps written in Objective-C

You may ask "why are you still writing apps in Objective-C?"
It's a fair question.  I was late to the game writing apps for mobile because I felt like Objective-C was a fairly high bar to clear.  If I don't have a reason to learn something, I won't learn it.  But I am also stubborn and would like to find something to help me power through learning this, so I can say I did it.

It's dumb - I get it
